ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Omid.
I recently started to learn programming with python at first to study and learn more about AI and data managing. but I have weakneses in math and algorithms. So I decided to put my efforts on web and desktop development.
I also like to add mobile app development to my list of skills.
After learning basics of python I switched to JavaScript and Node JS to become a full stack MERN developer which still there is a long wat to become a real one. But in this path I learnt basics of node JS and more of React JS, Mongo DB and Git and github.
I started to develope a website named omiGram as a social media replica something like Instagram and X but with more graphical touches to have a special charachter. I'm still working on it to make it compelete and also I'm working on deploying and hosting it as realtime website to use by end users.

Recently I finished working on a desktop app for a company I am working for to check prices of their products based on date and maby other inputs provided by company crews.

I am trying to design and deploy a portfolio website and also I want to work on desing and making some basic games.
